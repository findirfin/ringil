# Ringil

Ringil was an attempt to create a local-first AI chat interface that could connect to various AI models through their APIs. The project featured:

- Local chat history storage
- Multiple model support
- Customizable API settings
- Markdown export
- Chat search functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Input history navigation

## Project Status: Discontinued

This project has been discontinued due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) limitations when trying to connect directly to AI provider APIs from a browser-based application. These security restrictions make it impractical to implement the intended functionality without a backend server.

A similar project may be developed in the future using a different architecture, likely with a proper backend service to handle API communications securely.
